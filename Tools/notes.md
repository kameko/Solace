### General Plans/TODOs:
 - Version the entire system independently, the initial release will be 1.0.0.0. When a module's minor version is updated, it will tick the system build version (third place) by one. When a plugin's major version is updated, it will tick the system minor version by one. Not sure what to do with the last revision digit yet.
 - Do not delete log files, categorize them into folders: Decade -> Year - Month -> day.txt, example 2020/2021/January/1.txt
 - Create an extension to the module system to allow for raw C# code to be compiled into a DLL and loaded at runtime, to skip the manual build step. Also enable it to work with Git remote repositories.
 - Need a user system with permissions for local and remote connections to the bot.
 - Have the system batch-save how long it's been running to the database. Saving every second it's running is wasteful, so we'll wait for something that wants to save before saving the current timestamp. If nothing wants to save after a while, then we'll manually save the running time. Should be configurable, but by default, maybe every 5 minutes?
 - Conditionally load modules. Primarily for selecting specific modules for specific platforms, for example `SomeModule.Windows.x64` on Windows and `SomeModule.Linux.x64` on Linux.
 - Consider programmatic docker deployment of server instances with https://github.com/microsoft/docker.dotnet 
 - General-purpose analytics engine module that can be utilized by other modules and fed data to it. Both to track performance and runtime behavior and to formulate popularity or lack of popularity with any given data set (eg, what words were most used in a given discord channel, etc.)
 - Some kind of story generator, a mix of AI Dungeon and Drabble-Matic.

### Discord TODOs:
 - Discord Core module will use it's own database, probably SQLite, not depending on some system-wide database service. Discord Core module will offer query abilities that the Discord Commands module will be able to use.
 - Scriptable response system: Users should be able to use a scripting language to create intelligent responses.
 - System will automatically download all attachments when received. It will do this by categorizing attachments into a folder for that day, in a folder for that channel, in a folder for that guild. Each attachment will have an accompanying JSON file of the same name with details on what day it was, who uploaded it, what was their discord roles, what Solace permissions do they have, what was the current name of the guild, what the attaching message said, etc..
 - All downloaded attachments will be available to response scripts. A script can say to upload a file if they know the date/channel/guild/filename. Alternatively this system will simply allow a user to upload a file and get a GUID back for it, and they can just use that GUID. A response script that be used with this guid to create a memorable tag for uploading the GUID.
 - Periodically, the system will check duplicate files, delete the duplicate while keeping the JSON file, and update the JSON file to say what it is a duplicate of so the user can search there. The above system of accessing a file through it's date/channel/guild/filename will still function, it will just be redirected.
 - Anti-spam system to detect and prevent the bot from spamming the same message in a channel. Useful for haywire scripts or a lot of unhandled exceptions. Don't just detect exact messages, also detect messages that start or end the same but have some variety. If antispam activates, it goes on an auto-cooldown. When it activates, it sends a message to the last channel it responded in saying that anti-spam activated and that it can be disabled by saying ".\antispam disable" or something. Make sure to brand it SpamShieldÂ®.
 - Command ideas:
   - Make a fake ".\shutdown" command, have the real command be something like ".\initiate routine system-shutdown now". Fake command will have the bot go offline and them come back online. It can also be configured to say something while pretending to shut down and then when coming back online, either through a seperate command (sent through DMs probably) or from a system config.
   - Make a tag system, `.\tag create tagname "my tag contents"`, `.\tag echo tagname`, `.\tag delete tagname`
   - Do the same with uploads, `.\file create tagname` (with file attached), `.\file upload tagname`
   - Quoting feature
   - Conversation generator between selected people.

### Language TODOs:
 - Create a custom scripting language for scripting the system. SolaceScript (.sol)? Big requirement is it must be able to be preemptively multitasked by pausing between it's execution, something other embeddable languages don't offer.
 - Also use Lua (MoonSharp) and JavaScript/TypeScript (Jint) for users more familiar with them. Keep them in their own process so they can be killed.
 - Jint has a memory limit and timeout feature. We can use this in conjunction with not allowing long-running loops and creating a framework to handle iteration. Example:
 ```cs
    var result = new Engine(options =>
    {
        options.LimitRecursion(1);
        options.Strict();
        options.DiscardGlobal();
        options.TimeoutInterval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(0.5));
        options.MaxStatements(1);
        options.LimitMemory(500);
    })
    .Execute(javascript)
    .GetCompletionValue() 
    .ToObject();
 ```
 - It does not seem MoonSharp has the same abilities. Consider a Lua to JS converter such as https://github.com/mherkender/lua.js
 - MoonSharp is still fine either way because even if we can trust Jint, it's still going in it's own Language Server process seperate from other modules (which should also be able to be put into their own docker). However, we should split all languages into their own server process, so faulty MoonSharp scripts won't tred on trustworthy Jint scripts.
 - Lua is low-priority, don't bother until you actually want to.
 - Scripts should be trusted or untrusted, trusted scripts aren't subject to timeouts and other hard limits, so they can do more. Trusted scripts are scripts that have been verified and built into the system. Untrusted is user scripts, which are allowed to call trusted scripts to accomplish more.

### Frontend TODOs:
 - The default frontend, Terminal, is part of the Core folder (otherwise you couldn't communicate with the server), but all other frontends will be their out project outside of the Core folder.
 - Three frontends planned. Terminal is a basic bare-bones command frontend. After that I'd like to do another console based one but much fancier, a text-based windowing system (Solace.Pathos). The third one will be a full-blown ASP .NET/Vue .js browser frontend (Solace.Catharsis). All of these are designed with cross-platform in mind.
 - All frontends use TCP and can work across computers, there is no local-only frontend.

### Personality layers:
 - Make server-chan not respond to any message with her trigger in it that ends in a dot (.) Make it configurable too. Actually, rename Server 2003 to Server NT and only respond to NT. Again, configurable by chat users.
 - Change Server's name to Server NT.
 - Make server-chan more autonomous and context-sensitive. Give her a mode to toggle between classic mode (the simple markov chain) and smart mode, such as `.\personality server mode classic`. Or maybe just `.\personality classic`, not sure how I want to do the "personality infrastructure" yet.
