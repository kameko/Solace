**CURRENTLY ABANDONED.** This project, while fun, is too non-specific for my other projects that would eventually have used it. I'm currently abandoning it, and my other projects will use their own specific solutions to communicate with various social media platforms. I may pick it back up later.

Multipurpose, multi-platform, modular bot microservice framework emphasizing uptime with stability, targeting .NET 5.
